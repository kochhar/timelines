Syria, and it becomes al-Qaeda's enemy.","ISIS mostly fights not Assad, but the other rebels and the Kurds, carving out a mini-state it calls its Caliphate.","That summer, it marches across Iraq seizing territory, galvanizing the world against it.","The opposition in Syria divides between anti-Assad rebels and ISIS, who fight one another as well.","In September, one year after the US almost

in Turkey, even as the Kurds fight ISIS in Syria, but doesn't bomb ISIS.","This got to a core problem: the US sees ISIS as its main enemy, but the US’s allies like Turkey and a lot of other MidEast
