      "This is a major shift because the US has for years only focused on fighting ISIS.",

      "But the program stalls.",
      "At the same time, The US quietly urges Arab Gulf states to stop funding extremists, but the requests go unheeded.",
      "In August the Assad regime uses chemical weapons, provoking condemnation around the world Obama: \"Men, women, and children lying in rows \u2013 killed by poison gas...\" It is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike.",

      "In August, Turkey bombs Kurdish groups in Iraq and in Turkey, even as the Kurds fight ISIS in Syria, but doesn't bomb ISIS.",
